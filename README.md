# 🧠💾 Big Data Analysis Repository (a.k.a. The Labyrinth of Data Madness)

Welcome, brave 4th Year CS student of TIP!  
You have stumbled into the **official** (and questionably organized) realm of **Big Data Analysis** lab work. 🎉

This repo is your new best friend (until finals), containing:

- 📁 Laboratory exercise submissions (aka your ticket to passing)
- 📚 Supporting documents (some useful, some ancient scrolls)
- 🧪 Bonus brain cells (not guaranteed)

---

## 🧪 What Is This Sorcery?

This repository is where you'll dump—err, **submit**—your precious lab exercises for the semester. Think of it as your digital lab notebook, minus the coffee stains.

We’ll be wrangling data so big, it could crash your laptop.  
But hey, that’s what makes it fun. Right? Right?!

## 🛠️ How To Contribute (Because Sharing is Scaring)

1. Fork it like it's hot 🍴  
2. Clone your fork `git clone https://github.com/you/big-data-madness.git`
3. Create a branch `git checkout -b i-did-the-lab-finally`
4. Commit like a legend `git commit -m "Lab 1 done, send snacks"`
5. Push and make a PR (prayer request) 🙏

## 📜 Rules of the Repo (aka the Fine Print)

- ☑️ Submit your own work (your cat can’t code, we checked)
- ☑️ Respect deadlines (time waits for no coder)
- ☑️ Use meaningful commit messages (e.g., `fixed lab 2` = meh, `exorcised bugs from lab 2` = chef’s kiss)
- ☑️ No pushing to `main` unless you’ve been granted the sacred powers
