# 🧠💾 Big Data Analysis Repository (a.k.a. The Labyrinth of Data Madness)

Welcome, brave 4th Year CS student of TIP!  
You have stumbled into the **official** (and questionably organized) realm of **Big Data Analysis** lab work. 🎉

This repo is your new best friend (until finals), containing:

- 📁 Laboratory exercise submissions (aka your ticket to passing)
- 📚 Supporting documents (some useful, some ancient scrolls)
- 🧪 Bonus brain cells (not guaranteed)

---

## 🧪 What Is This Sorcery?

This repository is where you'll dump—err, **submit**—your precious lab exercises for the semester. Think of it as your digital lab notebook, minus the coffee stains.

We’ll be wrangling data so big, it could crash your laptop.  
But hey, that’s what makes it fun. Right? Right?!

## 📂 Folder Structure (Probably)

Everything is neatly tucked away using a meticulous directory structure because...we’re professionals like that:

### Directory Structure
📂 https://github.com/AI-Artisans/bda_cs41s1 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 Main&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#C2C0C0"><i>&lt;-- branch</i></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 [Name in LastNameFNMI]&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#C2C0C0"><i>&lt;-- branch</i></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 LAB-[LaboratoryDate: yyyymmdd]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 final-project<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 Tags<br>

### Example:
📂 https://github.com/AI-Artisans/bda_cs41s1 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 Main<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 DelaCruzJTI<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 LAB-LAB-20250809<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|- 📂 final-project<br>

### Naming Conventions:
1. Each student must create their own GitHub branch using the naming convention:
   **[Last Name][First Name Initial][Middle Initial]**
   _(E.g., `DelaCruzJTI` for Juan Tamad Inantok Dela Cruz)._

2. **Laboratory Submissions**:
   - Inside your branch, create a new folder for each laboratory session with the format:
     **`LAB-[yyyymmdd]`**
     _(E.g., `LAB-20250809` for the lab session on August 9, 2025)._

3. **Final Project Submission**:
   - Your final project should be added inside the `final-project/` folder within your branch. 
   - Use a separate branch name for project submission, as instructed later in the course.

Note: Folder names subject to change due to panic, typos, or last-minute professor updates. 😅

## 🛠️ How To Contribute (Because Sharing is Scaring)

1. Fork it like it's hot 🍴  
2. Clone your fork `git clone https://github.com/you/big-data-madness.git`
3. Create a branch `git checkout -b i-did-the-lab-finally`
4. Commit like a legend `git commit -m "Lab 1 done, send snacks"`
5. Push and make a PR (prayer request) 🙏

## 📜 Rules of the Repo (aka the Fine Print)

- ☑️ Submit your own work (your cat can’t code, we checked)
- ☑️ Respect deadlines (time waits for no coder)
- ☑️ Use meaningful commit messages (e.g., `fixed lab 2` = meh, `exorcised bugs from lab 2` = chef’s kiss)
- ☑️ No pushing to `main` unless you’ve been granted the sacred powers
